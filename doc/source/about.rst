About lamberthub
================

Origins of the library
----------------------

The library was born as a result of a performance comparison study between
different Lambert's problem solvers. The preliminary results were published in
the `8th International Conference on Astrodynamics Tools and
Techniques <https://atpi.eventsair.com/QuickEventWebsitePortal/20a05-gnc-2020/website>`_.
The report, titled `A critical review on the state-of-the-art of Lambert's
problem
solvers <https://github.com/jorgepiloto/lamberthub/tree/main/art/icatt_report.pdf>`_
is fully accessible.

The performance comparison work was completed and published by October 2021 as
part of the author's final thesis in aerospace engineering. You can download

Objectives and goals
--------------------

- To **collect all proposed solutions to the Lambert's problem and implement** those
  under a common programming language, so no undesired performance is introduced
  because of software.

- To **provide open source scientific software**, so all the **results can be
  reproduced by third parties and individuals**.

- To act as a **Lambert's problem algorithms vault**, preserving the knowledge behind
  this great problem and in particular, the very first proposed numerical
  solvers, playing the role of software archaeology.

- To **review Lambert's problem bibliography** to establish which
  authors have addressed the problem and when they did so.
