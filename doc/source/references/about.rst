About lamberthub
================
This section provides some ingishts about the reasons behind creating this library.

Origins of the library
----------------------
The library was born as a result of a performance comparison study between
different Lambert's problem solvers. The preliminary results were published in
the `8th International Conference on Astrodynamics Tools and Techniques
<https://atpi.eventsair.com/QuickEventWebsitePortal/20a05-gnc-2020/website>`_.

    A critical review on the state-of-the-art of Lambert's problem solvers

The performance comparison work was completed and published by October 2021 as
part of the author's final thesis in aerospace engineering. You can download

    Lambert's problem algorithms: a critical review

Objectives and goals
--------------------
The following objectives and goals apply for this library:

* Review Lambert's problem bibliography.

* Collect all proposed solutions to the Lambert's problem.

* Provide open source scientific software to guarantee reproducible science.

* Act as a Lambert's problem algorithms vault.
