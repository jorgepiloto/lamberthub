About lamberthub
================
This section provides some ingishts about the reasons behind creating this library.

Origins of the library
----------------------
The library was born as a result of a performance comparison study between
different Lambert's problem solvers. The preliminary results were published in
the `8th International Conference on Astrodynamics Tools and Techniques
<https://atpi.eventsair.com/QuickEventWebsitePortal/20a05-gnc-2020/website>`_.

    A critical review on the state-of-the-art of Lambert's problem solvers

The performance comparison work was completed and published by October 2021 as
part of the author's final thesis in aerospace engineering. You can download

    Lambert's problem algorithms: a critical review

Objectives and goals
--------------------

* To **collect all proposed solutions to the Lambert's problem and implement** those
  under a common programming language, so no undesired performance is introduced
  because of software.

* To **provide open source scientific software**, so all the **results can be
  reproduced by third parties and individuals**.

* To act as a **Lambert's problem algorithms vault**, preserving the knowledge behind
  this great problem and in particular, the very first proposed numerical
  solvers, playing the role of software archaeology.

* To **review Lambert's problem bibliography** to establish which
  authors have addressed the problem and when they did so.
