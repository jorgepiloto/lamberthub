The `lamberthub` library only provides routines for solving the Lambert's
problem. However, there exist other software packages which offer additional
capabilities on astronomy, astrodynamics, and orbital mechanics. This page
lists some of the most popular ones available for the Python community:

* **[astropy](https://www.astropy.org/)**: The Astropy Project is a community
  effort to develop a common core package for Astronomy in Python and foster an
  ecosystem of interoperable astronomy packages.

* **[poliastro](https://docs.poliastro.space/en/latest/)**: poliastro is an open
  source (MIT) collection of Python functions useful in Astrodynamics and
  Orbital Mechanics, focusing on interplanetary applications. It provides a
  simple and intuitive API and handles physical quantities with units.
