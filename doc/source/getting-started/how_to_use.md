# How to use

Once that you have installed the library, its time for you to learn how to use
it. The main goal of `lamberthub` is very simple: provide a collection of
algorithms for solving the Lambert's problem. 

All the routines are implemented in the form of Python functions, who's name is
given by the combination of original author's name plus the year of publication,
that is: `authorYYYY`.

## Checking for available solvers

To answer this question, simply run the following code snippet or refer to the
official package API reference:

```{code-cell}
from lamberthub import ALL_SOLVERS
print([solver.__name__ for solver in ALL_SOLVERS])
```

In addition, `lamberthub` provides other lists holding algorithms which
present particular features such as multi-revolutions or high-robustness. These
macros are listed down:

```{code-cell}
from lamberthub import ALL_SOLVERS, ZERO_REV_SOLVERS, MULTI_REV_SOLVERS, ROBUST_SOLVERS
```

## Import a particular solver

If you are only interested in using a particular solver, you can easily import
it by running:

```python
from lamberthub import authorYYYY
```

where `author` is the name of the author which developed the solver and `YYYY`
the year of publication. Any of the solvers hosted in the `ALL_SOLVERS` macro
can be used.

If you would like to use a solver which is not defined in `lamberthub`, open a
`solver request` in the [issues
board](https://github.com/jorgepiloto/lamberthub/issues) detailing all the
information related to the algorithm and any useful reference which can help to
implement it.

## Input and output parameters

Any of the routines in the library has the same number of input and output
parameters, that is because they all solve for the same astrodynamics problem.

As said before, any Lambert's problem algorithm implemented in `lamberthub` is a
Python function built with the following API architecture:

**Parameters**
* `mu`: the gravitational parameter, that is the mass of the attracting body
  times the gravitational constant.
* `r1`: initial position vector, needs to be a NumPy array instance.
* `r2`: final position vector, needs to be a NumPy array instance.
* `tof`: time of flight between initial and final vectors.

**Additional parameters**
* `M`: the number of desired revolutions. If zero, direct transfer is assumed.
* `prograde`: this parameter controls the inclination of the final orbit. If set
  to `True`, the transfer has an inclination between 0 and 90 degrees
  while if `False` inclinations between 90 and 180 are provided.
* `low_path`: selects the type of path when more than two solutions are available.
  There is no actual advantage on one or another solution, unless you have
  particular constrains on your mission. If `True`, the maximum value for the
  independent variable (when two solutions) is selected.
* `maxiter`: maximum number of iterations allowed when computing the solution.
* `atol`: absolute tolerance for the iterative method.
* `rtol`: relative tolerance for the iterative method.
* `full_output`: if `True`, it returns additional information such as the number
  of iterations.

**Returns**
* `v1`: initial velocity vector, it is a NumPy array instance.
* `v2`: final velocity vector, it is a NumPy array instance.

**Additional returns**
* `numiter`: number of iterations. Only of `full_output` has been set to `True`.
* `tpi`: time per iteration. Only if `full_output` has been set to `True`.


## A real example

The following section presents a real example[^1]. Suppose you want to solve for
the orbit of an interplanetary vehicle (that is Sun is the main attractor) form
which you know that the initial and final positions are given by:

$$
\vec{r_1} = \begin{bmatrix}
0.159321004\\
0.579266185\\
0.052359607\\
\end{bmatrix} \text{[AU]}\;\;\;\;\;\;
\vec{r_2} = \begin{bmatrix}
0.057594337\\
0.605750797\\
0.068345246\\
\end{bmatrix} \text{[AU]}
$$

the dimension of previous vectors is astronomical units [AU] and the time of
flight, given in years, is known to be $\Delta t = 0.010794065 \text{[year]}$.
The orbit is prograde since inclination is less than $90^{\circ}$) and
direct $M=0$. Remember that when $M=0$, there is only one possible solution, so
the `low_path` flag does not play any role in this problem.

To solve for the problem, first import a solver. For this problem,
`gooding1990` is chosen:

```{code-cell}
from lamberthub import gooding1990
```

Next, specify the initial conditions of the problem:

```{code-cell}
# Import NumPy for declaring position vectors
import numpy as np

# Initial conditions for the problem
mu_sun = 39.47692641  # [AU ** 3 / year ** 2]
r1 = np.array([0.159321004, 0.579266185, 0.052359607])  # [AU]
r2 = np.array([0.057594337, 0.605750797, 0.068345246])  # [AU]
tof = 0.010794065  # [year]
```

Finally, the problem can be solved. Notice that, as explained before, the
default value for the `prograde` flag is `True`, which matches the one from
problem's statement.

```{code-cell}
# Solving the problem
v1, v2 = gooding1990(mu_sun, r1, r2, tof)

# Let us print the results
print(f"Initial velocity: {v1} [AU / years]\nFinal velocity: {v2} [AU / years]")
```

previous values are the same ones coming from the original example.
