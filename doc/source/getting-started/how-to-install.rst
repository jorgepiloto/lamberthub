Installing from PyPI
--------------------

The installation process is similar to other python packages, meaning that you
only need to run:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install lamberthub

Previous command installs the latest stable version of the library. Once
done, you can open the Python terminal and import the package and verify its
version by running:

.. code-block:: python

    import lamberthub
    print(f"lamberthub v{lamberthub.__version__}")

.. code-block:: python

    lamberthub v|version|
