    r"""
    Lambert's problem solver using the method proposed by R. H. Gooding in 1990.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mu: float
        Gravitational parameter, equivalent to :math:`GM` of attractor body.
    r1: numpy.array
        Initial position vector.
    r2: numpy.array
        Final position vector.
    M: int
        Number of revolutions. Must be equal or greater than 0 value.
    prograde: bool
        If `True`, specifies prograde motion. Otherwise, retrograde motion is imposed.
    low_path: bool
        If two solutions are available, it selects between high or low path.
    maxiter: int
        Maximum number of iterations.
    atol: float
        Absolute tolerance.
    rtol: float
        Relative tolerance.
    full_output: bool
        If True, the number of iterations and time per iteration are also returned.

    Returns
    -------
    v1: numpy.array
        Initial velocity vector.
    v2: numpy.array
        Final velocity vector.
    numiter: int
        Number of iterations.
    tpi: float
        Time per iteration in seconds.

    Notes
    -----
    This module holds the Lambert's problem solver devised by R. H. Gooding in
    his technical report [1]_ originally published in 1988. However, the
    implementation corresponds to the one proposed by the author a couple of
    years later in his article [2]_ from 1990. Some improvements to the
    originally algorithm were also made by Klumpp in his performance comparison
    [3]_ between Lamberts problem solvers.  Those have been added to this code
    to prevent failures for particular inputs.  The result is a fully working
    algorithm for both single and multi-revolution orbits.

    The code has been kept as close as possible to the original FORTRAN-77  one.
    However, some statements (like "goto line" ones) have been deprecated as
    they introduce "spaghetti code". Since the original implementation imposed a
    relative tolerance together with the number of iterations, these parameters
    have been modified so the user can freely choose their values.
