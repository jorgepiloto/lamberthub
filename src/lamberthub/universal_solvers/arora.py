    Notes
    -----
    Lambert's problem solver using the method proposed by Nitin Arora and Ryan
    P. Rusell in 2013, see [1]. This algorithm exploits the universal formulae
    by defining a new cosine-based transformation and developing a robust
    initial guess. Although based on arbitrary conditions, the algorithm shows a
    high performance.
