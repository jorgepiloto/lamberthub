"""
Lambert's problem solver using the method proposed by Giulio Avanzini in 2008.

This module holds the implementation of the algorithm devised by Avanzini, which
appeared for the first time in his article [1]. The solver takes advantage of
the conservation of the eccentricity projection along the chord direction, so it
iterates over this orbital element till the time of transfer from Kepler's
equation matches the desired transfer one.

However, the original routines was not developed to work under multi-revolutions
conditions. In addition, Avanzini did not provide the derivative of Kepler's
equation with respect to the transverse eccentricity component, forcing a
bounded numerical method (bisection or regulafalsi). This was solved by Quan He,
which proposed new changes to Avanzini's original algorithm in an article [2]
proposed in 2010.

Finally, a new method [3] was proposed by Changxuan Wen in 2014, simplifying all
previous routines.
