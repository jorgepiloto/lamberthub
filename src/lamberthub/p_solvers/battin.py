    r"""
    Battin's elegant algorithm for solving the Lambert's problem. This algorithm
    is known to improve Gauss original one by removing the singularity for 180
    transfer angles and increasing its performance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mu: float
        Gravitational parameter, equivalent to :math:`GM` of attractor body.
    r1: numpy.array
        Initial position vector.
    r2: numpy.array
        Final position vector.
    M: int
        Number of revolutions. Must be equal or greater than 0 value.
    prograde: bool
        If `True`, specifies prograde motion. Otherwise, retrograde motion is imposed.
    low_path: bool
        If two solutions are available, it selects between high or low path.
    maxiter: int
        Maximum number of iterations.
    atol: float
        Absolute tolerance.
    rtol: float
        Relative tolerance.
    full_output: bool
        If True, the number of iterations and time per iteration are also returned.

    Returns
    -------
    v1: numpy.array
        Initial velocity vector.
    v2: numpy.array
        Final velocity vector.
    numiter: int
        Number of iterations.
    tpi: float
        Time per iteration in seconds.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm originally devised by Gauss exploits the so-called ratio of
    sector to triangle area, which is a numerical value related with the orbital
    parameter. This Algorithm was used to the discovery of the orbit of Ceres by
    the genius and adopted by many other authors of his time due to its
    simplicity. However, the Algorithm is found to be singular for transfer
    angles of 180 degrees and shows a low performance for really small angles.
