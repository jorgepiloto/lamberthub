# Welcome to lamberthub documentation

The `lamberthub` library is a Python package which provides its users with
different algorithms for solving the Lambert's problem:

Since the formulation of the problem, many different solutions have been
devised, being the latest ones in the form of computer routines. By collecting
and implementing all of them under a common programming language, it is possible
to carry out performance comparisons between those. Furthermore, `lamberthub`
provides a framework for new authors to select the robustness and accuracy of
their routines.
